# SwiftUI-FetchAPIValues-Maps
I have created a project which will show how to get JSON values from API and Integration of MapKit in SwiftUI.

## Concepts
I have used UIKit's MapKit by integrating them in swiftUI project using UIViewRepresentables.
I have implemented how to fetch api and remote image data from url in swiftUI
